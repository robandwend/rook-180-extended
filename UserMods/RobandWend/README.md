# ROOK-180 - mods by robandwend (Robertg)

## THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS - CHANGES ARE LIKELY

## PLAN

My plan is to build a Rook-180, extended in the Y by 100mm to allow room for 3 hotends (either 3 TD6S's or 4 if I use the Bambu hotends and bowden again) that are give me multi-filament printing.

The bed will still be 180x180, slightly further back (10mm) due to the hotend being rotated 180°. This rotation lets it be driven to the back, where a pair of clips will clip on, and allow the hotend to detatched. The clips on the rear being opened/closed by a strong servo. The hotends will rest on two spikes that fit into the holes on the hotend. (Hopefully this explanation it will make sense as I post more photos).

Each hotend will need it's own wiring, and will carry the power for the cooling fan. The cooling fan and probe will remain on the X-Carriage, power/cables being passed to it from the removable front.

The hotend design is almost finished - see images. This required squeezing in the magnets, and some position-locking pyramids, I've weight tested the design using simple blocks with the magnets/pyramids and weights etc, and the connection appears very stable and strong.

The design required me to add 4mm to the front length of the hotend and reducing the rear by 4 - thus keeping the part cooling correctly positioned.

I've also had to move the probe back very close to the X rods ** DESIGN NOLONGER HAS THIS CHANGE ** , to allow it to remain with the gantry when the hotends switch. One final thing I need to do is slightly modify the left part cooling pipework to correctly go around the probe.

Here's the current status...

# 12864

Also created a 12864 Display Bracket that fits as a replacement front top brace.

This is not specific to the extended 180

# MKS MONSTER8 Mount

This mount is specific to the extended 180, and replaces both the middle lower right braces, extending out to mount the Monster8.

A similar mount it available for an Orange PI 4 LTS based off the front middle brace - as seen in photo below.

# PI MOUNT

There are actually two similar PI mounts available, initially I was using an orangepi 4 LTS, however due to problems getting the gpio working (as a secondary MCU) - I reverted to an raspberry-pi 4b

# MEX - Multi Extruder

## Rear Hotend Storage Area 

To allow for multi-extrude, a rear hotend storage area has been designed.

## Fan cooling and bl-touch

The whole hotend has been reversed (so part cooling fan now at the front). The wiring for the part-cooling fan and the bl-touch remain on the x-carriage at all times. The 5015 adaptor has a small change to allow the wiring to be neatly attached. Current plan is to use a non-functioning piece of bowden to route these two wires to the board. The bl-touch wiring will be routed between the two x-rods.

## Bowden Extruders

Clip on bowden extruder mounts (for basic cheapest extruders) have been added

Or you could use some Voron M4 Extruders

## Bambu bowden hotend

Since the bambu hotend is quite cheap, and speedwise beats many expensive nozzles, like in my original Rook mods I've added a bambu hotend (for bowden). This has options for either a standard cooling far, or one of the smaller bambu size 2020 fans.

## Z-Endstop

# Horseshoe Spool holder

I chose to fit two horseshoe spoolholders to either side

Note - for my specific spool size (195mm diameter) a resized STL is provided.
